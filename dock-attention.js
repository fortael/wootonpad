// dock-attention.js — the dock icon as a status light.
//
// Two signals, deliberately different in kind:
//
//   the badge   how many sessions want something — the board's WAITING INPUT
//               and DONE columns added together. A number you glance at.
//   the bounce  one session has just become blocked on a dialog and is holding
//               up work. A thing that interrupts you.
//
// A finished turn never bounces. It is finished; it can wait.
//
// The count cannot be derived from session-status.js, because "done" is not a
// status — it is "finished a turn and you have not put it away yet", which only
// the window knows (see readPendingSessions in public/app.js). So the renderer
// reports it and this decides what the dock does about it.
//
// Everything platform-specific is injected rather than imported: `app.dock` is
// undefined off macOS and `app` cannot be required outside Electron at all,
// which would leave this untestable.
