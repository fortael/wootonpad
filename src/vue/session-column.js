// rail and IN PROGRESS on the board.

// One answer, one precedence order, used by both.

 * DONE while you have it open — that is the column saying "finished, not yet
 * put away" — but the moment you open it you have read it, and a dock badge
 * still counting it is telling you to go somewhere you already are. So the
 * done half counts unread turns only: `responseReady`, never `readPending`.
 *
 * Placement still goes through columnOf, because the collections overlap: a
 * session you opened after it finished and then sent back to work is in
 * `readPending` *and* `busy`, and it is working, not finished.
